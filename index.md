# A mentoring program for Open Science ambassadors in Life Science


**Purpose**: Training for early stage researchers and young leaders interested in furthering their 
Open Science skills.

**Outcome**: Ambassadors for Open Science practice, training and education across multiple European 
and international bioinformatics communities. 

**Process**: A 12-week mentoring program, based on the [Mozilla Open Leader program](https://foundation.mozilla.org/en/opportunity/mozilla-open-leaders/), helping participants in becoming Open Leaders by using three principles:

1. **Sharing** essential knowledge required to create, lead, and sustain an Open Source project.
2. **Connecting** members across different communities, backgrounds, and identities by creating space in this program for them to share their experiences and expertise.
3. **Empowering** them to become effective Open Science Leaders in their communities as ambassadors for Open Science practices.


## Values


We want to make this program mutually beneficial for all the participants. 
Here are a few values we think you will receive from participating in this project.

- Become a member of this community of shared aims
- Exchange skills and build your profiles
- Highlight your resources by sharing them with the community
- Collaborate with others in Open Science projects
- Develop projects to publish online
- Participate in designing this program by sharing your feedback and experience
- Gain insights from other experts in the field
- Gain recognition and acknowledgement for your work
- Become leaders and embassadors of Open Science in your network

## Schedule

The first phase of Open Life Science will launch in early 2020!

- **Late-October - Early-November 2019**: Opening of the applications
- **Late-November 2019**: Closing of the applications
- **Mid-December 2019**: Selection of the 
- **Mid-January 2020**: Start of the 12-week program

    *A detailed schedule of the program will be available soon*


## The program itself

Important contents related to Open Life Science and education will be included to design a **12-week program** hugely inspired by the previous [Mozilla Open Leader](https://foundation.mozilla.org/en/opportunity/mozilla-open-leaders/) programs. 

To illustrate the program here, we will share the persona/story of Joy, a mentee participating in the program, and Sam, their [personal mentor](about#mentors). As they progress through their **open leadership journey**, they will be involved in the following steps of this program:

1. In their applications, they will indicate their interests in the topics related to Open Science and education in bioinformatics. Joy will **provide a short outline of their project**, and Sam will **list their expertise** that they want to share with their mentee. 
2. Based on their common interests, they will be introduced to each other as **suitable mentee-mentor pair**.
3. A first cohort call will be scheduled where Joy will **get to know all the participants** of the program, present their project, and learn about others' projects. 
4. The content of the program will be shared and discussed in the following bi-weekly online calls:
    - In the cohort calls, the program leaders will **introduce new topics and resources**, facilitate break-out discussions, and invite [expert](about#experts) from the field to give talks.
    - In mentors-only calls, Sam will participate in topic-based discussions with other mentors to **enhance their mentoring skills**.
    - In mentee-mentor calls, Sam will help Joy **evaluate their understanding** of the new topics, and **review their progress** by providing constructive feedback. Joy will be given relevant assignments before these calls to help them apply new skills in their project.

5. When needed, Joy and Sam will be able to connect with other [experts](about#experts) and **get consulted** on their project.
6. A final cohort call will allow Joy to **present their project** to other participants and exchange values.
7. A **self-evaluation survey** will help Joy and Sam in positioning their knowledge in open leadership before and after the program.
8. Joy and Sam **will receive certificate of participation**, validating their time, commitments, and willingness to become Open Leaders and experts respectively.
9. Joy will share what they learnt by [mentoring](about#mentors) a project and Sam will become an [expert](about#experts) when they **return to the next round**.


## Applications


This program will focus on open science and education in the life sciences and bioinformatics domains.

We are particularly keen to connect with the participants from less-represented European countries such as Hungary, Greece, Estonia, and Cyprus. We also invite applicants from outside Europe, particularly from developing countries (e.g. India and Africa - who are also timezone-compatible).

Cohort calls will be conducted in English. However, our participants who have different primary languages such as Spanish, French, German, Hindi, and Portuguese, will be paired with mentors who can communicate in their preferred languages.

**Interested to participate? The application for will open in October-November 2019.**
